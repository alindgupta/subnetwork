two microarray datasets = wt and rfx-
two outputs = involved in ciliogenesis or not

m = total number of genes
fi = discriminative score for ith gene where i = [1..m]

MRF
S = {m genes}, {Ni = connections of gene i in S}

1-vertex clique = {S}
2-vertex clique = {{gene i with its markov blanket according to S}}

s.t.

P(f) > 0 (Discriminative marginal score for a node)
P(fi|f(s-{i}) = P(fi|fNi) (Markov assertion of independance)


P(fi) ~ Gibbs = 1/C * exp(-1/T u(f))
u(f) depends on clique potentials
T is a hyperparameter

Z-scores (discrimnative scores)
Z = {Zi}, i = 1..m 
Z is sampled from inverse normal cum density function of p-values, which are gotten from t-test
Z = f + e where e ~ N(0,1)

want arg max <f> log P(f|Z)
which is equiv to arg min <f> u(f) + u(z|f) -> go to eq 3


1. calculate degrees
2. total number of edges
3. netscore of clique
4. Z-scores from microarray data
